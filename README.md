# Fred Roche Foundation subscription app

This is an ammended version of the GoCardless Pro Ruby example to work with the new API.

The app passes details to the GoCardless api to retrieve a redirect flow, and set up customers with mandates
to pay the Fred Roche Foundation for their annual friends programme.
